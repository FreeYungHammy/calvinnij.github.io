        <p class="AlphaA" style="font-size:30px;">The development of the internet is a fascinating and complex subject.
             As a means for government researchers to exchange information, the internet 
             first appeared in the 1960s and over time developed into a vast network of computers and gadgets.
             Many causes impacted the internet, including the Cold War, the space race, 
             the development of new technology, and the vision of pioneers.  
        </p>
         <br>
       
       <p class="AlphaA" style="font-size:30px;"> Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, the so-called "Fathers of the Internet," created 
            the abstract technology utilised by billions today in the 1960s.
            In August 1962, J.C.R. Licklider outlined how an interconnected group of computers could be
             accessed globally, introducing us to networks.
            Many engineers and scientists worked on the Internet's information theory to establish 
            interconnected computer networks. This resulted in the creation of a dozen Internet Protocols.

        <br>
        <p class="AlphaA" style="font-size:30px;">As networks took shape, 
            they each fulfilled a function that eventually gave rise to the Internet and continues to do so:

                <dd>-Donald Davies created it after learning what J.C.R. Licklider had envisioned.</dd>
                <dd>-With packet switching as the goal, the NPL Network acted as a local area computer network.</dd>

                <dd>-It was the first area computer network.</dd>
                <dd>-It was one of the earliest networks to make use of the IP protocol.</dd>
                <dd>-It allowed computers to share resources.</dd>

                <dd>-High-performance computer networking is provided.</dd>
                <dd>-Its purpose is to deliver government services such as health care and education.</dd>
