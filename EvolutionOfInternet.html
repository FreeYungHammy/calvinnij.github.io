                <h2 >Intro</h2>

                <p>The ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) initiative, which sought to develop a reliable communication network resilient to faults, can be linked to the development of the internet. This project resulted in the creation of ARPANET, the forerunner to the current internet. The success of ARPANET served as the basis for the growth of the internet.
                </p>
                
                

                <p>TCP/IP, a collection of protocols that allowed various computers to communicate easily across networks, was one crucial advancement. This development signalled a turning point, enabling standardised data transmission and laying the foundation for the current worldwide network.
                </p>

              

                <p>The foundational technologies of modern networking include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System). IP manages addressing and routing, whereas TCP assures dependable data transmission.

                <h3 class="htype1B"> The ARPA Project</h3>
                
                
                <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a division of the US Department of Defence, provided funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the precursor to the Internet. It served as the Internet's starting point throughout its formative years and as a testing ground for numerous internetworking technology components. Leased lines were used to connect packet-switching equipment when the ARPANET was being developed (Gartner, n,d.).
                </p>
    
                <h3>The basis of contemporary networking </h3>

                <p>The basis of contemporary networking is TCP/IP, however it is not a single, unified protocol. Instead, it is a group of protocols that, depending on the situation and the goal, adhere to various models and standards.
                     </p>

                <p> The foundation of modern networking rests upon five key protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System). TCP guarantees dependable data transfer, while IP manages destination addressing and route selection. HTTP enables seamless web interaction, SMTP oversees efficient email delivery, and DNS converts domain names into numerical IP codes. These protocols together form the bedrock of internet operations, showcasing the incredible journey from the early ARPA initiative to today's intricate and interconnected digital domain. This evolution underscores how these protocols collectively shape and empower the contemporary online landscape.</p>

                            <li class="myListB"><h4 class="htype2B">TCP/IP model</h4></li>
                            <p>The most popular and widely acknowledged paradigm for describing the functions and levels of network protocols is the TCP/IP model. Application, transport, internet, and network access make up its four layers. Each layer uses the service of the lower layer and offers a certain service to the top layer. The TCP/IP paradigm promotes interoperability between various protocols but is not a rigid standard (LinkedIn, n,d.).</p>
                            
                            <li class="myListB"><h4 class="htype2B">The OSI Model</h4></li>
                            <p>The OSI model offers a wider and deeper framework for characterising network protocols than the TCP/IP paradigm. The seven tiers are Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. (“Connecting all the things in the Internet of Things - IBM Developer”) A standard, not a protocol, describes how each layer's operations and interfaces work according to the OSI model. Although the OSI model is rarely applied in practical applications, it is useful for describing and understanding networks (LinkedIn, n,d.).</p>
        
                    
                            <li><h4 class="htype2B">The DoD model</h4></li>
                            <p>The older and simpler DoD model was developed by the US Department of Defence to explain network protocols. Host-to-host, network, and process/application make up the three layers. The DoD model is similar to the TCP/IP paradigm despite integrating the application, presentation, and session levels into a single layer and having different names for the transport and internet layers. The DoD idea served as the foundation for the early TCP/IP protocols (LinkedIn, n,d.).</p>
        
                       
                      <li><h4 class="htype2B">The Internet Protocol Suite</h4></li>
        
                        
                      <p>The set of protocols that implements the TCP/IP architecture is known as the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP, DHCP, DNS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and numerous other protocols are included in it. Every protocol adheres to a standard that establishes its guidelines and defines its specific purpose and format. In response to the creation and adoption of new protocols, the Internet Protocol Suite is continuously growing and changing (LinkedIn, n,d.).</p>

                        <p>The TCP/IP blogs and podcasts are online sources that offer knowledge and insights on various facets of TCP/IP networking. They were developed and are maintained by professionals, enthusiasts, and practitioners who share their expertise and experience with the network community. (LinkedIn, n,d.).</p>
