        <h1 class="headJ">Overview of the World Wide Web</h1>
       
        <div class="boxJ">
        <p style="font-size:larger;">The world wide web, often called the web or WWW, is not the same as the internet. 
            Itâ€™s a part of the internet. 
            The WWW is a bunch of websites that people can see on their computers or other devices using the internet. 
            Which can contain words, sounds, and videos. 
            The world wide web can be seen as a massive electronic book with many pages.
             These pages are connected with special links you can click on. 
             Each link takes you from one part of a page to another, or to a completely different page. 
             These links make the web a collection of connected pages. 
             These pages are stored on different computers all around the world. 
             You can think of it as building blocks of the web.  
        </p>
       
       <p style="font-size:larger;"> Hypertext is a method to create connections between pieces of information on the internet. 
            Which is like creating paths that lead from one point to another. 
            This method allows content on one web to be directly connected to content on another web page or even website altogether.
             When you're reading something on a web page and you come across a link, that link is a form of hypertext. 
            Clicking on it transports you to another page, which might be related to what you were reading or provide more detailed information. 
       </p>
        
        
        <p style="font-size:larger;"> HTTP, which stands for Hyper Transfer Protocol, is the technology that makes seamless linking possible. 
            Because of HTTP, people can explore the diversity of websites that exist on the World Wide Web. When you type a web address (also known as URL) into your browser's address bar and press enter, your browser sends an HTTP request to a web server. 
            The server responds with the requested web page's content, which your browser then displays. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:larger;"> Google, Bing, and Yahoo can be seen as examples of search engines. 
            Search engines are like a helper that helps you find specific categories(websites-pages) on the internet. 
            In conclusion the World Wide Web connects everyone and everything around the world. 
            This has changed the way we talk to each other, learn things, and much more. 
            Thus, we can see the World Wide Web as an important tool that lets us share our ideas and work together, no matter where we are. We can also conclude that the web has made our lives much easier, from talking to friends far away to finding answers to our questions. The World Wide Web is like a highway of information that has changed our world and keeps growing and changing every day.
